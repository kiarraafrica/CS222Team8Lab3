# Digital Diary

## 🧩 Project Description and Features
A *Digital Diary* that allows users to maintain personal diary entries. This offers two modes: a **normal diary** and a **secure diary**. Each entries are stored in text files, with timestamps automatically added to each entry.

1. Two Diary Modes
	- 📓 Normal Diary
	- 🗝 Secured Diary

2. Core Functionality
	- ✍️ Write Entry: Add new timestamped entries to the diary
	- 📖 View Entries: Display all saved diary entries
	- 🔍 Search by Date: Find entries from a specific date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- 🖊️ Edit Entry: Modify existing diary entries
	- ❌ Delete Entry: Remove entries from the diary

## 🧠 How OOP Principles are Used
This diary application leverages the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism— to build a clean, extensible, and maintainable codebase.
	- 🔐**Encapsulation**
		> is achieved by grouping related data and methods inside classes like Diary and SecureDiary. Internal file operations (ReadAllLinesToList, WriteLinesToFile) are hidden from external acces and exposed through public methods such as WriteEntry, EditEntry, and DeleteEntry.
		> the password in SecureDiary is stored in a private field (_password) and accessed internallu, ensuring it's not exposed to outside classes.

	- 🎯 **Abstraction**
		> is demonstrated through the use of the IDiary interface
		> IDiary defines essential diary operations like WriteEntry, GetAllEntriesAsList, SearchByDate, etc., without ecposing implementation details.
		> consumers of the diary interact with the diary through the IDiary interface, allowing flexibility in swapping implementations.

	- 🧬 **Inheritance**
		> is used by extending the base Diary class into a more specialized SecureDiary.
		> SecureDiary inherits standard diary functionality and overrides only the necessary parts to add password protection (e.g., reading/writing entries).
		> this prevents code duplication and promotes reuse.

	- 🔁 **Polymorphism**
		> is utilized through method overriding in SecureDiary (ReadAllLinesToList, WriteLinesToFile) to change behavior while preserving the interface.
		> the ability to reference both Diary and SecureDiary using the IDiary interface, enabling flexible nd interchangeable diary usage.
